Abstract
Punishment promotes contributions to public goods, but recent evidence suggests that its effectiveness varies across 
societies. Prior theorizing suggests that cross-societal differences in trust play a key role in determining the effectiveness 
of punishment, as a form of social norm enforcement, to promote cooperation. One line of reasoning is that punishment 
promotes cooperation in low-trust societies, primarily because people in such societies expect their fellow members to 
contribute only if there are strong incentives to do so. Yet another line of reasoning is that high trust makes punishment 
work, presumably because in high-trust societies people may count on each other to make contributions to public 
goods and also enforce norm violations by punishing free riders. This poses a puzzle of punishment: Is punishment 
more effective in promoting cooperation in high- or low-trust societies? In the present article, we examine this puzzle 
of punishment in a quantitative review of 83 studies involving 7,361 participants across 18 societies that examine the 
impact of punishment on cooperation in a public goods dilemma. The findings provide a clear answer: Punishment 
more strongly promotes cooperation in societies with high trust rather than low trust.

One  pervasive  challenge  to  groups,  organizations,  and 
societies  is  the  free-rider  problem:  People  may  benefit 
from collectively provided public goods but not contrib-
ute their fair share. The term free riding may well have its 
roots  in  someone  using  public  transportation  without 
paying the fare—and thus enjoying a “free ride.” Although 
tempting, the quality of the public good in question, pub-
lic  transportation  in  this  case,  might  be  undermined  as 
there are more people free riding. Likewise, it is in the 
individual’s interest to minimize paying taxes and keep as 
much as possible for oneself, yet the nation needs income 
from taxes to optimally serve its members—by maintain-
ing the quality of public goods, such as education, infra-
structure,  and  safety  in  society.  Or  in  the  context  of 
smaller groups, just imagine a group project where the 
quality of the project is enhanced by the contributions of 
each  group  member.  However,  it  may  be  tempting  for 
each individual to allocate valuable time and energy to 
more  enjoyable  activities,  while  hoping  that  the  other 
group members will work on the group project.

Over the past several decades, social and behavioral 
scientists  have  examined  behavior  in  such  public  good 
dilemmas with the use of an experimental paradigm in 

which participants are faced with a decision about how 
much to contribute (e.g., money) to a public good. Since 
its beginning, one of the key questions has been “How 
do groups and societies minimize free riding and instead 
promote  contributions  to  public  goods?”.  Several  solu-
tions  have  been  examined,  and  to  some  degree  sup-
ported,  in  past  research.  For  example,  people  are  less 
likely to free ride and more likely to cooperate if people 
communicate, if they perceive their cooperative efforts to 
be  more  efficacious,  and  when  people  are  less  anony-
mous  (for  reviews,  see  Balliet,  2010;  Chaudhuri,  2011; 
Gächter & Herrmann, 2009; Van Lange, Balliet, Parks, & 
Van  Vugt,  in  press).  A  potentially  even  more  powerful 
solution has been suggested by recent research: Free rid-
ing  is  dramatically  reduced  if  people  in  a  public  good 
task are endowed with the option to punish each other.

Indeed,  in  two  seminal  articles,  Fehr  and  Gächter 
(2000,  2002)  developed  a  public  good  paradigm  that 
demonstrated  that  the  use  of  punishment  could  effec-
tively increase contributions to public goods. In this para-
digm, participants interact in a small group and have an 
opportunity to contribute to a public good or to free ride 
on the contributions of their group members. After mak-
ing their decision, each group member learns about the 
decision of the other group members, and at that point 
they decide to pay a cost to reduce the earnings of any 
specific  group  member(s)—thus  punishing  their  group 
member(s). Fehr and Gächter found that over time people 
tended to make greater contributions to the public good 
with  the  presence  of  punishment  opportunities  than  
they  did  when  punishment  opportunities  were  absent. 
Subsequent  research  replicated  and  supported  the  con-
clusion that individuals are willing to pay a cost to punish 
free  riders  and  that  this  can  effectively  and  efficiently 
increase contributions to public goods (Gächter, Renner, 
& Sefton, 2008; Gürerk, Irlenbusch, & Rockenbach, 2006; 
Ostrom, Walker, & Gardner, 1992; Rand, Dreber, Ellingsen, 
Fudenberg, & Nowak, 2009; Rockenbach & Milinski, 2006; 
Yamagishi,  1986;  for  a  recent  meta-analysis,  see  Balliet, 
Mulder, & Van Lange, 2011).1

Recently,  cross-societal  studies  on  punishment  have 
found  much  variation  across  societies  in  the  degree  to 
which punishment promotes cooperation (Balliet et al., 
2011;  Henrich,  Ensminger,  et  al.,  2010;  Henrich  et  al., 
2006;  Herrmann,  Thöni,  &  Gächter,  2008;  Marlowe  & 
Berbesque, 2008). In many societies, punishment is effec-
tively directed toward free-riders and promotes coopera-
tion; yet in other societies, the effectiveness of punishment 
to promote contributions to public goods is weak or even 
absent  (Herrmann  et  al.,  2008).  For  example,  in  some 
societies, such as Denmark and China, punishment works 
well,  whereas  in  other  societies,  such  as  Turkey  and 
South Africa, punishment hardly works at all. One impor-
tant reason punishment works is because punishment is 
largely  delivered  to  free  riders.  However,  punishment 
does not work in some societies because people punish 
cooperators  or  group  members  who  contribute  more 
than 
themselves—so-called  “antisocial  punishment” 
(Herrmann  et  al.,  2008).  Certainly,  the  punishment  of 
cooperators can undermine cooperation. Thus, in some 
societies, punishment can be countereffective.

Can some aspect of cultural differences explain why 
the  effectiveness  of  punishment  in  promoting  coopera-
tion is so strongly dependent on the societies in which 
the  studies  are  conducted?  Clearly,  societies  differ  in  a 
number of ways, but one key cultural difference among 
various  societies  is  the  beliefs  that  people  hold  about 
other people’s benevolence—that is, in trust (Bond et al., 
2004). Trust is often defined in terms of the willingness  

to accept vulnerability on the basis of the positive expec-
tations of the intentions or behaviors of others (Rousseau, 
Sitkin,  Burt,  &  Camerer,  1998;  see  also  Balliet  &  Van 
Lange, 2012). As shown repeatedly, individuals differ in 
how  much  they  trust  others  in  general  (Rotter,  1967; 
Yamagishi, 1988, 2011), groups and organizations differ 
in the extent to which group members trust each other 
(Dirks, 1999), and even societies can differ in the degree 
to  which  societal  members  trust  others  (Inglehart, 
Basanez,  &  Moreno,  1998;  Knack  &  Keefer,  1997).  For 
example, in some societies a lost wallet is believed to be 
returned immediately, whereas in other societies people 
are  not  that  trusting  (Knack,  2001).  Such  differences  in 
trust are important to public goods, because people with 
high  trust  are  more  likely  to  contribute  (Balliet  &  Van 
Lange, 2012; Fischbacher, Gächter, & Fehr, 2001; Gächter, 
Herrmann, & Thöni, 2004; Yamagishi, 1988) and varying 
levels of trust might reflect norms about expected contri-
butions to public goods (Coleman, 1988; Doney, Cannon, 
& Mullen, 1998). In the present research, we examine the 
possibility that differences in trust among societies play a 
key  role  for  understanding  the  effectiveness  of  punish-
ment to promote cooperation.

How might punishment work in societies that differ in 
trust? One perspective assumes that punishment should 
be especially effective in low-trust societies. The reason-
ing  is  that  in  high-trust  societies,  most  people  already 
contribute to the public good: The belief that most others 
can be trusted renders punishment an unnecessary cost 
to encourage contributions. Also, in high-trust societies, 
people may believe that most people have internalized 
norms  against  free  riding,  so  that  norm  enforcement 
through punishment is not needed. In contrast, in low-
trust societies, punishment is necessary because people 
do not expect their fellow members to contribute in the 
absence of incentives to do so, but in low-trust societies 
the presence of punishment increases expectations that 
others will contribute to public goods (Yamagishi, 1986, 
1988).

Another, competitive perspective assumes that punish-
ment  is  especially  effective  in  high-trust  societies.  The 
reasoning is that in high-trust societies, societal members 
adhere  to  norms  that  encourage  both  cooperation  and 
punishment  of  free  riders.  Specifically,  punishment  of 
free riders poses a “second-order” dilemma, such that it is 
in each group member’s material interest to not punish 
norm violators and to free ride on the benefits provided 
by  others  who  do  punish.  Thus,  in  high-trust  societies 
people may count on each other to enforce norm viola-
tions and punish free riders (Coleman, 1988). Moreover, 
in high-trust societies, when people deviate from these 
norms and free ride on others’ contributions, punishment 
may induce a sense of guilt and encourage subsequent

cooperation. However, in low-trust societies, these norms 
might  be  less  strongly  shared  and  enforced,  such  that 
punishment  may  induce  anger  and  fail  to  encourage 
cooperation,  resulting  in  the  antisocial  punishment 
observed in certain societies (Gintis, 2008).

This poses the following puzzle of punishment: Does 
punishment  promote  greater  contributions  to  public 
goods in low or high-trusting societies? We sought to illu-
minate this puzzle of punishment by conducting a quan-
titative  analysis  of  experimental  studies  implemented 
across 18 societies on the effect of punishment on contri-
butions in a public goods dilemma.

Additional Issues: Market 
Competitiveness, Religion, and Social 
Capital
Besides trust, we were able to test some other possible 
reasons why punishment would be more or less effective 
in promoting cooperation across societies. Prior research 
on the use of punishment to promote cooperation across 
small-scale societies has found that punishment is more 
frequently used to sustain cooperation in societies with  
a  strong  market  economy  or  with  a  greater  number  of 
societal  members  adopting  a  world  religion  (Henrich, 
Ensminger,  et  al.,  2010).  Although  the  present  analysis 
includes only large-scale societies that all possess market 
economies and exposure to world religions, these societ-
ies do vary in the functioning of their markets and the 
extent to which societal members participate in religion. 
Therefore,  we  also  examined  whether  variation  across 
these societies in market competitiveness and participa-
tion in religion predicted the effectiveness of punishment 
to promote cooperation.

Theory  of  social  capital  also  applies  to  the  present 
analysis.  Social  capital  is  essentially  the  idea  that  the 
benevolence of others in one’s social network is a valu-
able  resource  that  provides  benefits  (and  sometimes 
costs) to individuals in terms of both economic and social 
exchange  (Adler  &  Kwon,  2002).  Two  facets  of  social 
capital include trust and cooperative norms accompanied 
by  sanctions  (Coleman,  1988;  Ostrom  &  Ahn,  2008; 
Portes, 1998). Therefore, this perspective predicts a posi-
tive correlation across societies among trust, cooperative 
norms, and the effectiveness of punishment in promoting 
cooperation. Thus, this perspective similarly predicts that 
cross-societal  variation  in  trust  will  positively  relate  to  
the effectiveness of punishment to promote cooperation. 
Additionally, this perspective predicts that societies that 
possess stronger norms for cooperation will also display 
greater  effectiveness  of  punishment.  We  will  test  this  
perspective  by  examining  whether  variation  in  norms  
of  civic  cooperation  relates  to  the  effectiveness  of 
punishment.

Overview of the Meta-Analysis
In  this  article,  we  report  a  meta-analysis  involving  83 
studies  of  the  impact  of  punishment  on  cooperation 
across 18 different countries, involving a total number of 
7,361  participants.  To  maximize  the  consistency  across 
studies,  we  included  only  those  studies  that  used  the 
experimental paradigm developed by Fehr and Gächter 
(2002). All studies included in this meta-analysis used this 
protocol. By applying a meta-analytic approach, we aim 
to  explain  variation  in  the  effect  size  by  considering 
cross-societal  differences  in  trust  while  controlling  for 
several  methodological  study  characteristics  that  vary 
across studies as well as between-country differences in 
wealth,  wealth  inequality,  democracy,  market  competi-
tiveness,  religious  participation,  and  norms  of  civic 
cooperation.

Methods
Search for studies and study criteria
We  searched  several  databases  for  published  studies, 
including  PsycINFO,  EconLit,  Google  Scholar,  and  
the  Web  of  Science.  We  searched  the  entire  text  of 
English-language journal articles by using the term pun-
ishment along with cooperation terms (e.g., public goods 
dilemmas  and  voluntary  contribution  mechanism).  We 
searched the references of all relevant articles for studies. 
We  also  contacted  over  150  researchers  who  attended  
the  2007  and  2009  International  Conference  for  Social 
Dilemmas for data. In addition, we posted a call for data 
to  the  Economic  Science  Association  methods  group 
(http://groups.google.com/group/esa-discuss).  Last,  we 
requested data from authors who published articles on 
punishment in public good dilemmas in the last 5 years.
All studies had to have been conducted on adult par-
ticipants (age 18 and above). Studies had to have exam-
ined the effect of punishment on cooperation in a public 
goods  dilemma.  We  included  only  those  studies  that 
compared a punishment condition with a control condi-
tion. As noted earlier, we included only those studies that 
manipulated  peer  punishment  by  using  the  methods 
developed by Fehr and Gächter (2000, 2002). In this par-
adigm, several people come to the lab and are randomly 
assigned to play a public goods dilemma game with three 
other persons.

The typical public goods experiment proceeds in two 
stages. In the first stage, participants make their decision 
about how much to contribute to the public good. Each 
participant  is  endowed  10  monetary  units  (MUs)  and 
then decides between how much of that money to donate 
to a group fund (the public good) or an individual fund. 
Any amount contributed to the group fund is multiplied 
by  1.5,  and  then  distributed  equally  across  all  group

members. The amount allocated to the individual fund is 
not multiplied. Each group member simultaneously and 
confidentially makes his or her decision. Next, the sec-
ond  stage  begins.  Participants  are  made  aware  of  their 
group members’ decisions and are given an opportunity 
to pay to punish their group members. Specifically, par-
ticipants are given the opportunity to pay 1 MU to reduce 
their partner’s earnings by 3 MUs. Last, participants are 
told whether they were punished, and how much they 
earned on that trial. The game is often played for several 
trials—either  with  the  same  group  members  (partner 
design) or with random assignment to a new group on 
each trial (stranger design). The effect of punishment on 
contributions is derived by comparing a punishment con-
dition with a control condition, where participants make 
only their contribution decisions and are not provided the 
opportunity to punish others. Using these criteria to find 
relevant studies uncovered a total of 33 papers that con-
tained 83 studies (effect sizes) and 7,361 participants.

Coding procedure
Although  the  studies  included  in  the  meta-analysis 
involved  a  highly  standardized  experimental  protocol, 
the  studies  varied  by  the  number  of  group  members, 
number of iterations, and whether the participants con-
tinued  to  remain  in  the  same  group  throughout  the 
experiment or were reassigned to a new group for each 
trial. We coded these study characteristics, as described 
below,  and  controlled  for  these  between-study  differ-
ences when conducting our analyses. We used the same 
coding  criteria  as  employed  in  prior  research  (Balliet  
et al., 2011). Specifically, we coded group size, the num-
ber of iterations, and whether the study employed a part-
ner-matching  or  stranger-matching  protocol.  We  also 
coded cross-societal variation in wealth, wealth inequal-
ity, market competitiveness, religious participation, norms 
of civic cooperation, the extent of democracy, and gener-
alized trust in others, which we describe below.

Partner protocol.  All studies in this meta-analysis used 
the  paradigm  developed  by  Fehr  and  Gächter  (2000, 
2002). Fehr and Gächter had participants play an iterated 
4-person  public  goods  dilemma  game  allowing  partici-
pants  an  opportunity  to  punish  their  partners  in  the 
dilemma  after  each  trial.  Originally,  Fehr  and  Gächter 
composed two conditions: the stranger design and part-
ner design. In the stranger design, participants play out 
the  same  dilemma  for  several  trials  but  are  randomly 
assigned to a new group after each trial. In the partner 
design, however, participants remain anonymous but are 
not reassigned to a new group after each trial and remain 
in the same group for the entire experiment. We coded 

whether  the  study  used  the  partner  design  (k  =  45)  or 
stranger design (k = 28).

Number  of  iterations.  Participants  were  allowed  to 
interact only once, or the dilemma could occur repeat-
edly  for  several  iterations.  The  sample  of  effect  sizes 
includes  both  one-shot  (k  =  9)  and  iterated  (k  =  72) 
dilemmas. We coded the number of iterations as a con-
tinuous variable (M = 10.24, Mdn = 10).

Group size.  We coded group size as a continuous vari-
able (range = 3 to 7). The mode of group size was a four-
person group (k = 46; M = 4, Mdn = 4).

Country of participants.  The studies were conducted 
in 18 different countries. Most studies were conducted in 
the United States (k = 15), United Kingdom (k = 15), Swit-
zerland (k = 10), Russia (k = 7), Netherlands (k = 6), and 
Israel (k = 4). Other countries represented include Aus-
tralia, Belarus, China, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Italy, 
Saudi  Arabia,  South  Africa,  South  Korea,  Turkey,  and 
Ukraine.  The  country  for  each  effect  size  is  labeled  in 
Table 1.

National  wealth.  We  used  gross  domestic  product 
(GDP) per capita as an index of a country’s wealth. We 
coded GDP per capita for each society by using the index 
provided  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (http://
www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2011/02/weodata/
index.aspx). We used the estimates of GDP per capita for 
the year 2011. Because this variable is not normally dis-
tributed, we transformed GDP by using the logarithm. All 
analyses were conducted with the transformed logarith-
mic GDP variable. Higher scores indicate more wealthy 
countries, and the logarithmic scores ranged from 8.19 for 
Ukraine to 11.30 for Switzerland (M = 10.48, SD = 0.70).

Wealth inequality.  The Gini index is used as a mea-
sure of cross-societal differences in wealth inequality. We 
used  data  reported  in  the  Human  Development  Report 
(United Nations Development Programme, 2010). Of the 
societies represented in our sample the Gini values range 
from  24.7  for  Denmark  to  67.4  for  South  Africa  (M  = 
36.17,  SD  =  9.52).  Lower  Gini  scores  indicate  greater 
amounts of equality in wealth.

Market  competition.  We  coded  each  country’s  score 
on the global competitive index reported by the World 
Economic Forum (Schwab, 2012). This is a measure of a 
country’s  competitiveness  and  productivity.  Competive-
ness is defined as a “set of institutions, policies, and fac-
tors that determine the level of productivity in a country” 
(Schwab,  2012,  p.  4).  The  index  considers  12  different

components that are groupings of variables that impact a 
country’s  productivity.  Of  the  societies  included  in  our 
sample, scores ranged from 3.92 for Greece to 5.74 for 
Switzerland (M = 5.20, SD = 0.50). Higher scores indicate 
more competitive countries.

Religious  participation.  We  used  a  measure  of  reli-
gious  participation  from  the  latest  wave  of  the  World  
Values  Survey  (WVS;  http://www.worldvaluessurvey 
.org/) and the European Values Survey (EVS; http://www 
.europeanvaluesstudy.eu/).2  We  used  the  measure  of 
church  attendance  over  the  last  year  with  the  question 
“apart from weddings, funerals, and christenings, about 
how often do you attend religious services these days?”. 
Responses  range  from  1  (more than once a week)  to  8 
(practically never). Of the countries in our sample, church 
attendance ranged from 3.48 for South Africa to 6.20 for 
the Netherlands (M = 5.61, SD = 0.53). Higher scores indi-
cate less religious participation.

Norms of civic cooperation.  We used the latest wave 
of the WVS and EVS to measure norms of civic coopera-
tion within each society. We followed previous research 
(e.g., Herrmann et al., 2008) by averaging responses to 
three items on the survey. Each item asks the respondent 
to what extent a specific behavior is justifiable: (a) claim-
ing  government  benefits  that  you  are  not  entitled  to,  
(b)  avoiding  a  fare  on  public  transportation,  and  (c) 
cheating on taxes if you have a chance. Responses range 
from  1  (never justifiable)  to  10  (always justifiable).  We 
reverse-coded  the  scale  so  that  high  scores  indicate 
greater  norms  of  civic  cooperation.  In  our  sample,  the 
index of norms of civic cooperation ranged from 7.00 for 
Greece to 9.39 for Turkey (M = 8.70, SD = 0.50). Higher 
scores equal stronger norms of civic cooperation.

Democracy.  The  extent  of  a  society’s  democracy  is 
taken from the democracy index. This index is based on 
several different measures of the electoral process, civil 
liberties, and political participation. We coded the democ-
racy index from the Economist Intelligence Unit (2010). 
Of  the  countries  in  our  sample,  the  democracy  index 
ranged from 1.84 for Saudi Arabia to 9.52 for Denmark 
(M  =  6.91,  SD  =  2.29).  Higher  scores  indicate  greater 
democracy.

Generalized  trust  in  others.  For  each  country  we 
used the WVS and EVS to measure generalized trust in 
others. The WVS and EVS measure generalized trust with 
responses  to  the  item “Generally  speaking,  would  you 
say that most people can be trusted or that you need to 
be very careful in dealing with people?” (1 = most people 
can be trusted and 2 = you can never be too careful when 
dealing  with  people).  To  create  a  trust  score  for  each 

society we examined observations from a country’s latest 
wave of the WVS and EVS. The trust score indicates the 
percentage of people who claimed that most people can 
be trusted. Because the WVS is administered to people 
age 18 and above, and because the experimental studies 
included in the meta-analysis are primarily young adults 
(ages 18–25), we examined the correlation between age 
and  trust  within  each  society  and  coded  the  predicted 
score of trust for people age 21.5. Using this approach we 
have  an  estimated  amount  of  trust  in  each  society  that 
better reflects the age group contained in the experimen-
tal studies used in the meta-analysis. To keep these pre-
dicted trust scores comparable to the trust index used in 
prior research we multiplied each predicted value by 2. 
Scores  ranged  from  8.60  for Turkey  to  165.81  for  Den-
mark  (M  =  78.17,  SD  =  30.43).  Higher  scores  indicate 
greater amounts of trust.

Overview of analysis
In our analyses, we used the d statistic as the measure of 
effect size. This value is the difference between the mean 
levels of cooperation in the punishment and control con-
ditions, divided by the pooled standard deviation. A posi-
tive d value shows greater cooperation in the punishment 
condition,  relative  to  a  control  condition.  We  used  the 
means and standard deviations to calculate the d values, 
but  when  these  statistics  were  not  reported,  we  calcu-
lated the d values by using the sample size along with 
the F score or t value. The d value is the dependent vari-
able in our primary analyses.

Some studies allowed us to code multiple effect sizes. 
For example, a study could include a control condition 
and  two  different  punishment  conditions.  This  study 
allowed  us  to  code  two  effect  sizes.  However,  the  two 
effect sizes are nonindependent because they share the 
same control condition. Therefore, we applied Cooper’s 
(1998) shifting-units-of-analysis approach to handle non-
independent effect sizes when doing our analyses. Using 
this  approach,  we  averaged  over  all  the  effects  from  a 
single study. This created one effect size for each study 
with  multiple  nonindependent  effect  sizes.  These  com-
bined effect sizes were used in each of the analyses.

For  the  analyses  we  report  below,  we  first  estimate 
and report the overall average effect size for the effect of 
punishment on cooperation. We then report the average 
effect  size  in  each  of  the  countries  represented  in  our 
sample.  We  calculated  these  estimated  effect  sizes  by 
using  a  random  effects  model.  A  fixed-effect  model  is 
inappropriate because we assumed that we did not have 
the entire population of studies and that there is system-
atic  between-study  variation.  Specifically,  we  assumed 
that the effect of punishment on cooperation would vary 
systematically across countries and that this variation may

be explained, at least in part, by cross-societal differences 
in the generalized trust in others. We assessed the esti-
mated variation in the effect size distributions by using 
several indicators of heterogeneity of variance (T, T 2, and 
I 2).

We  also  examined  the  possibility  that  the  effect  size 
distribution contains a publication bias. In so doing, we 
formally examined the distribution of studies in a funnel 
plot (plotted according to their effect size and standard 
error)  by  using  Egger’s  regression  intercept  and  Duval 
and Tweedie’s (2000) trim and fill approach.

Last,  we  report  random  effects  multiple  regression 
models  with  method  of  moments  estimations  by  using 
the  between-study  and  between-country  moderators  to 
predict the effect size. A random effects model is a rela-
tively conservative statistical test compared with a fixed 
effect  model  (Lipsey  &  Wilson,  2001).  To  examine  the 
hypothesis that cross-societal variation in trust relates to 
the effect size, we first tested the relation between trust 
and the effect size and then added several control vari-
ables to observe whether they changed this relation. In 
all of our models, because we had 69 observations, we 
included no more than seven predictor variables. To con-
duct our analyses we used the SPSS statistical MACROs 
provided by Lipsey and Wilson (2001).3

Results
Overall analysis of the effect of 
punishment on cooperation
We  begin  our  analysis  by  reporting  the  main  effect  of 
punishment on cooperation across all societies. Table 1 
reports the average effect of punishment on cooperation 
for each study included in the meta-analysis and lists the 
between-study codings of the moderators for each study. 
Prior to all analyses, we created an average effect size for 
studies  with  multiple  nonindependent  effect  sizes. This 
reduced the sample of effect sizes (from k = 83 to k = 69).
Averaging across all societies, punishment had a mod-
erate, positive effect on cooperation in the public goods 
dilemmas (d = 0.77, 95% CI [0.63, 0.91], 90% prediction 
interval  [0.16,  1.71]).  Next,  we  assessed  the  estimated 
variation in the effect size distribution by using several 
indicators  of  heterogeneity  of  variance  (T,  T 2,  and  I 2). 
The indicators of heterogeneity of the effect size distribu-
tion suggest that there is variation in the true effect size 
distribution  (T 2  =  .31,  T  =  .55)  and  that  a  substantial 
amount of this variation can be explained by between-
study differences (I 2 = 93.10%).

This effect size estimate could have resulted in a pub-
lication  bias,  as  the  majority  of  studies  included  in  the 
analysis  were  published  studies.  In  order  to  examine  
the possibility of a publication bias, we first considered 

the funnel plot where all studies were plotted according 
to  their  effect  size  and  standard  error  (see  online  sup-
porting materials at http://pps.sagepub.com/supplemen-
tal).  We  used  the  trim  and  fill  approach  to  analyze 
symmetry  in  the  funnel  plot  (Duval  &  Tweedie,  2000). 
This method examines the symmetry of the effect size in 
the funnel plot and then attempts to estimate where miss-
ing  studies  would  fall  in  the  plot  that  would  produce 
symmetry in the funnel plot. The method estimates the 
value of these missing effects sizes through an iterative 
process of removing the most extreme effect sizes with 
small samples from either side of the plot. If there is a 
publication bias, then we can expect that this approach 
will estimate that the sample is missing studies below the 
overall effect size. The analysis then inputs these missing 
effect  sizes  to  the  sample  of  studies  and  calculates  a 
smaller  overall  effect  size  without  publication  bias.  In 
taking  this  approach,  there  were  no  estimated  missing 
studies above the overall effect size. Asymmetry did exist, 
however, and was characterized by missing studies below 
the overall effect size. The trim and fill approach added 
12 studies below the overall effect size and recalculated 
an average effect size that was slightly smaller than the 
original estimated effect size (d = 0.57, 95% CI [0.43,0.71]). 
Moreover,  we  found  a  statistically  significant  Egger’s 
regression intercept (intercept = 4.68), t(68) = 5.99, p < 
.001, which indicates a possible publication bias. Taken 
together, these results suggest that the sample contained 
a possible publication bias that is usually characterized 
by  missing  null  findings.  Adjusting  the  estimated  effect 
size while taking these studies into consideration resulted 
in  a  slightly  smaller  estimated  effect  of  punishment  on 
cooperation,  compared  with  the  overall  analysis.  An 
analysis of Orwin’s fail-safe N finds that 546 studies with 
an effect size of d = 0.00 would be necessary to reduce 
the average effect size below d = 0.05.

Punishment and cooperation across 
18 societies
Next, we report the effect sizes separately for each soci-
ety. Table 2 reports the estimated average effect size for 
each society represented in the analysis along with the 
cross-societal  codings  of  trust,  national  wealth,  democ-
racy, economic inequality, market competition, religious 
attendance,  and  norms  of  civic  cooperation  for  each 
country.  As  displayed  in  Table  2,  there  is  much  cross-
societal variation in the impact of punishment on coop-
eration.  Although  punishment  effectively 
increases 
cooperation in some countries, such as Israel (d = 1.27), 
the Netherlands (d = 1.76), and Switzerland (d = 1.04), 
punishment  is  much  less  effective  in  other  countries, 
such as Russia (d = 0.03), Greece (d = −0.16), and Saudi 
Arabia  (d  =  −0.15).  Next,  we  examined  whether

cross-societal variation in trust may explain some of this 
cross-societal  variation  in  the  effectiveness  of  punish-
ment to promote cooperation.

Moderator analyses
We  were  primarily  interested  in  examining  the  relation 
between cross-societal variation in trust with the effect of 
punishment on cooperation in a public goods dilemma. 
When testing for this relation, we first examined the vari-
ance  in  the  effect  size  distribution  explained  by  cross-
societal  variation  in  trust  (Model  1).  We  then  observed 
how this relation was affected by adding the three study 
characteristics that vary across studies: partner protocol, 
number of iterations, and group size (Model 2) and then 
cross-societal  differences  in  GDP  per  capita  (Model  3), 
democracy (Model 4), and wealth inequality (Model 5). 
Next, because we restricted our model to no more than 
seven  predictor  variables  at  once  (given  a  sample  of  
69  effect  sizes),  we  dropped  a  nonsignificant  cross- 
societal  index  from  the  model  (wealth  inequality)  and 
then  added  either  market  competition  (Model  6),  reli-
gious attendance (Model 7), or norms of civic coopera-
tion (Model 8).

We  report  the  correlations  between  these  variables 
and  trust  in  Table  3.  As  displayed  in  Table  3,  national 
wealth (GDP), wealth inequality (Gini), and market com-
petitiveness  all  had  significant  correlations  with  trust. 

High-trust  societies  are  wealthier,  have  less  wealth 
inequality, and involve more market competition than do 
low-trust societies. Table 4 reports the results of the eight 
random effects multiple regression models using method 
of moments estimations.

As reported in Table 4, Model 1 explained a significant 
amount of variation in the effect size distribution (R2 = 
.11, p < .001). Cross-societal variation in trust had a posi-
tive relation with the effect size (β = .33, p = .001). This 
indicates that punishment is more effective at increasing 
cooperation in high-trust societies than it is in low-trust 
societies.4

In  Model  2,  we  added  the  study  characteristics  (i.e., 
partner  protocol,  number  of  iterations,  and  group  size); 
this model explained a significant amount of variation in 
the effect size (R2 = .38, p < .001). Both partner protocol 
and number of iterations had a statistically significant rela-
tion  with  the  effect  of  punishment  on  cooperation.  For 
partner  protocol,  punishment  more  effectively  increased 
cooperation  when  participants  were  reassigned  to  the 
same group for several trials than when they were reas-
signed  to  a  new  group  each  trial  (β  =  .30,  p  =  .001). 
Punishment was also more effective at increasing coopera-
tion as the number of trials of the dilemma increased (β = 
.33, p < .001). The effect of punishment on cooperation 
did  not  vary  as  a  function  of  group  size.  Cross-societal 
variation in trust continued to have a significant positive 
correlation with the effect size (β = .38, p < .001).

In Models 3, 4, and 5 we added GDP per capita, wealth 
inequality,  and  the  democracy  index,  respectively.  In 
Model 3, GDP per capita, had a significant positive rela-
tion with the effect size (β = .21, p = .046). Punishment 
had a stronger positive effect on cooperation in wealthier 
countries than it did in less wealthy countries. However, 
when the democracy index was added to Model 4 then 
GDP per capita did not have a significant positive rela-
tion with the effect size (β = −.03, p = .840). In this model, 
democracy had a marginally significant positive relation 

with the effect size (β = .28, p = .057), which indicates 
that punishment was more effective at promoting coop-
eration in high-democratic counties than it was in low-
democratic countries. In Model 5, the Gini index did not 
relate  to  the  effect  size.  In  Model  5,  trust  continued  to 
have  a  significant  positive  relation  with  the  effect  size  
(β  =  .35,  p  =  .006).5  It  is  important  to  note  that  cross-
societal variation in trust had a significant positive rela-
tion  with  the  effect  size  across  all  five  models.  This 
indicates that punishment was relatively more effective at

increasing cooperation in countries with higher levels of 
trust in others.

In Models 6 through 8, we dropped the Gini index and 
added market competitiveness, religious attendance, and 
norms  of  civic  cooperation,  respectively.  None  of  these 
variables  had  a  significant  relation  with  the  effect  size, 
although norms of civic cooperation had a marginally sig-
nificant positive relation with the effect size (β = .24, p = 
.073). Punishment was more effective at promoting coop-
eration in countries with stronger norms for cooperation. 
Trust continued to have a positive relation with the effect 
size  after  controlling  for  these  variables.  The  relation 
between trust and the effect size for each country is dis-
played in Figure 1.

Discussion
The primary purpose of the present meta-analysis was to 
test two competing predictions about how cross-societal 
differences  in  trust  may  moderate  the  relation  between 
punishment and its effect on cooperation in public goods 
experiments.  Using  a  meta-analytic  approach  involving 
more than 7,000 participants from 18 societies, we pro-
vide  strong  evidence  for  the  perspective  that  trust  and 
social  norm  enforcement  may  reinforce  each  other  in 
securing and promoting cooperation in large-scale soci-
eties. This is indicated by the positive relation between 
cross-societal  trust  and  the  effect  of  punishment  on 
cooperation  in  public  goods.  The  broad  conclusion  to 

Fig.  1.  The  scatterplot  displays  the  relation  between  the  effect  of  
punishment  on  contributions  to  public  goods  (d  value)  and  cross-
societal  variation  in  trust  across  18  societies,  after  controlling  for  
three  between-study  and  three  between-country  variables  (Model 
8  reported  in  Table  2).  AU  =  Australia,  BY  =  Belarus;  CN  =  China;  
DE  =  Germany;  DK  =  Denmark;  GR  =  Greece;  IL  =  Israel;  IT  =  Italy;  
NL = Netherlands; RU = Russia; SA = Saudi Arabia; ZA = South Africa; 
KR = South Korea; CH = Switzerland; TR = Turkey; UA = Ukraine; UK = 
United Kingdom; US = United States.

this puzzle of punishment is clear: The effectiveness of 
punishment in promoting cooperation in a public goods 
experiment is greater in societies with high trust, rather 
than low trust.

Such evidence is consistent with recent findings that 
the  use  of  punishment  to  promote  cooperation  among 
strangers is closely linked to a society’s social norms for 
contributions  to  public  goods  and  the  punishment  of 
free-riders  (Henrich,  Ensminger,  et  al.,  2010;  Henrich  
et al., 2006; Herrmann et al., 2008). Moreover, the present 
findings unpack the puzzle of punishment even further 
by providing novel support for the perspective that soci-
etal levels of trust and the enforcement of social norms 
are  mutually  reinforcing.  In  the  following  sections,  we 
address  the  relation  between  trust  and  norm  enforce-
ment; discuss some theoretical and practical implications 
this relation has for understanding the workings of small 
groups, organizations, and societal institutions; and sug-
gest directions for future research.

Trust, punishment, and cooperation
Earlier, we reasoned that in high-trust societies, societal 
members  may  adhere  to  norms  that  encourage  both 
cooperation and the punishment of free riders (Coleman, 
1988). However, in low-trust societies, these norms may 
be less strongly shared and enforced, so punishment may 
be less effective in these societies. We propose that it is 
unlikely that a single causal direction underlies the rela-
tionship  between  trust  and  norm  enforcement  but  that 
both variables may be mutually reinforcing in promoting 
cooperation. Below, we offer some theoretical perspec-
tives that might help us explain the mechanisms underly-
ing this relation.

One perspective centers on the causal role of trust in 
facilitating norm enforcement. Trust includes a benevo-
lent view of others’ intentions, which is likely to affect 
judgments  of  others  who  engage  in  the  costly  punish-
ment of non-cooperators. In high-trust societies, punish-
ment  is  likely  to  be  viewed  as  attempts  to  enforce 
cooperative norms, which encourages others to behave 
according to such norms. For example, Balliet and col-
leagues  (2011)  found  support  for  their  reasoning  that 
punishments were more effective at promoting coopera-
tion when they were more costly (versus free of costs) to 
administer. From this perspective, it is possible that the 
primary mechanism is rooted in communication: A will-
ingness to pay a cost to punish others, especially non-
cooperative  others,  is  likely  to  be  viewed  as  a  strong 
concern  with  collective  outcomes.  At  the  same  time, 
such  benevolent  views  of  costly  punishment  may  be 
more  likely  to  occur  in  societies  that  contain  higher 
amounts of trust in others, which we conceptualized ear-
lier in terms of beliefs about benevolence toward the self 
and others.

Thus, trust in others may result in benevolent percep-
tions  of  cooperative  norm  enforcers,  which  may  have 
two  effects  that  sustain  cooperative  norms.  First,  such 
benevolent  perceptions  of  punishers  may  result  in  an 
enhanced  status  or  reputation  of  the  punishers  (dos 
Santos, Rankin, & Wedekind, 2011; Nelissen, 2008), which 
may  subsequently  reinforce  the  punishment  of  non-
cooperators. Second, in high-trust societies, people may 
be more inclined to perceive their own noncooperation 
as a violation of a social norm and feel guilty for having 
violated  such  a  norm  (McGraw,  1987).  Therefore,  indi-
viduals may begin to cooperate in response to punish-
ment.  However,  in  low-trust  societies  that  emphasize 
strong  family  ties  and  lack  norms  of  cooperation  with 
strangers, people may respond negatively to being pun-
ished for not cooperating with other strangers. Instead of 
increasing their cooperation they may choose to retaliate 
and punish others who cooperate (i.e., antisocial punish-
ment; see Gintis, 2008).

Another  perspective  is  that  punishment  promotes 
norms of cooperation, which leads to greater amounts of 
societal trust. That is, although trust may promote effec-
tive  norm  enforcement,  so  may  effective  norm  enforce-
ment  promote  trust.  Indeed,  Ostrom  and  Ahn  (2008) 
claimed that trust is an outcome of successful collective 
action, which increases trust in others. So what facilitates 
successful collective action before the emergence of trust? 
Prior research on small-scale societies suggests that infor-
mal  norm  enforcement  of  cooperative  norms  might  be 
promoted by both the extent of market exchange between 
strangers  and  the  extent  that  societal  members  adopt  a 
major  world  religion  (Henrich,  Ensminger,  et  al.,  2010). 
We found that the extent of market competition or partici-
pation in religion (at least as measured by church atten-
dance) did not predict the effectiveness of punishment to 
promote  cooperation.6  Thus,  these  cross-societal  differ-
ences may not necessarily extend to the present sample 
of countries. Yet, in contrast to prior research on small-
scale societies, our analysis included large-scale modern 
industrialized societies that all possess relatively extensive 
market economies and exposure to world religions.

Another  possibility  is  that  norms  and  formal  institu-
tions that encourage individuals to establish and maintain 
social  relations  beyond  an  extended  kin  network  may 
promote  cooperation  among  unrelated  others  and  the 
enforcement of such cooperative group norms (Coleman, 
1988;  Fukuyama,  1995;  Putnam,  1993).  Countries  that 
possess  norms  for  maintaining  strong  family  ties  may 
inhibit interactions between unrelated others which may 
undermine  the  development  of  cooperative  norms 
between strangers (Fukuyama, 1995; Putnam, 1993).

There is indeed some recent support for this perspec-
tive. A case in point is research by Ermisch and Gambetta 

(2010)  which  revealed  that  people  who  tend  to  spend 
more time with their family and on family care displayed 
less  trust  in  strangers,  compared  to  individuals  who 
spend  less  time  with  their  family.  These  findings  raise 
intriguing  questions:  For  example,  how  exactly  might 
family  ties  inhibit  trust  and  cooperation  with  strangers? 
And assuming that there are important benefits to form-
ing  and  maintaining  exchange  relations  with  others 
beyond an extended kin network, an important question 
is how people come to interact cooperatively with strang-
ers,  develop  norms  for  cooperative  interaction  with 
strangers,  and  provide  a  climate  for  effective  norm 
enforcement. Future research on such issues may go far 
in explaining cross-societal variation in cooperation.

Trust and norm enforcement: A social 
capital perspective
It is interesting to view the present findings in light of the 
conceptualization  and  workings  of  social  capital—a 
widely  used  concept  with  broad  implications  for  the 
functioning and development of a society (see Adler & 
Kwon,  2002;  Coleman,  1988;  Fukuyama,  1995;  Putnam, 
1993).  Trust,  norms  of  cooperation,  and  the  effective 
enforcement of norms are conceptualized as interrelated 
components of social capital (Coleman, 1988; Ostrom & 
Ahn, 2008; Portes, 1998), which holds important implica-
tions  for  understanding  the  functioning  of  societies, 
including market economies (Knack & Keefer, 1997) and 
government (Ostrom & Ahn, 2008; Putnam, 1993).

The present research provides evidence that effective 
norm  enforcement  for  cooperative  behavior,  which 
results in greater success in the provision of public goods, 
positively relates to a society’s level of trust and norms of 
civic  cooperation.  Moreover,  in  additional  analyses  we 
combined the measures of trust and social norms to cre-
ate an index of social capital and found that this had a 
strong positive relation with the effect size (see supple-
mental materials). As such, we found novel support for 
the position that trust and the enforcement of coopera-
tive norms are positively associated, as would be expected 
from a social capital perspective.

An implication of the present findings is that societies 
that  succeed  in  establishing  cooperative  norms  and 
greater trust among strangers should be more capable of 
expanding social networks embedded in those societies 
and beyond (Buchan et al., 2009), by providing a formal 
or informal climate in which new members will behave 
according to the cooperative group norms that exist in 
those networks (Coleman, 1988). In this perspective, the 
prevalence of informal norm enforcement facilitates the 
expansion  of  cooperative,  social  networks,  further  bol-
stering the development of social capital.

Norm enforcement and democracy
Cooperation among societal members and the willingness 
to punish free riders may be essential to the well-being of 
large-scale institutions (Henrich, Ensminger, et al., 2010; 
Putnam,  1993).  Successful  economies  and  governments 
may occur as a result of a multitude of societal members 
engaging in successful collective action in the production 
of  public  goods  (Ostrom  &  Ahn,  2008).  For  example, 
democratic governments thrive in societies where citizens 
freely  engage  in  public  life  by  participating  in  debates, 
electing  representatives,  and  joining  political  parties  (La 
Due Lake & Huckfeldt, 1998; Putnam, 1993).

Theory and research suggest that social capital embod-
ied  in  social  networks  within  a  society,  such  as  norms 
that  are  sanctioned,  are  positively  related  to  political 
engagement and participation, which is the cornerstone 
of  a  successful  democracy  (La  Due  Lake  &  Huckfeldt, 
1998; Putnam, 1993). Thus, an implication is that success-
ful societal institutions may gain and maintain their suc-
cess  via  informal  social  processes  realized  among  the 
social networks within those societies. The present find-
ings  provide  some  preliminary  evidence  in  support  of 
this basic argument. Specifically, with those lines of rea-
soning  in  mind,  we  explored  the  relation  between  the 
extent of political participation by societal members and 
the  effect  of  punishment  on  cooperation  (see  supple-
mentary  materials).  We  found  that  cooperative  norm 
enforcement was more effective in societies with higher 
levels of political involvement by societal members, even 
when  controlling  for  societal  differences  in  trust  and 
norms of cooperation.

The present research is promising, in that it clearly dis-
plays that the informal enforcement of cooperative norms 
positively relates to participation in democratic societies. 
Yet, further research is needed to more closely examine 
the  relation  between  human  cooperation  and  the  func-
tioning  of  large-scale  institutions,  such  as  governments. 
Doing so will help develop tailored approaches to encour-
aging cooperation—potentially including such behaviors 
as political participation by societal members. This issue 
is all the more pressing given the many societies that are 
currently making the transition from authoritarian regimes 
to  more  democratic  states.  Strategies  that  harness  the 
power of informal social processes to support the work-
ings of such institutions may provide a key solution to a 
long-standing challenge faced by such societies.

Societal implications
Our findings hold important implications for the interac-
tions  within  small  groups,  to  understanding  the  suc-
cessful  workings  of  organizations  and  larger  societal 
institutions. One important direction for future research 

is  to  examine  whether  our  findings  readily  extend  to 
small groups and organizations, such that those that con-
tain greater amounts of trust also possess an enhanced 
ability  for  the  effective  enforcement  of  cooperative 
norms. One implication of our work is that organizations 
that have successfully developed trust through organiza-
tional members participating in informal norm enforce-
ment may well consider an organizational structure that 
allows employees to monitor and sanction their own per-
formance  of  specific  behaviors,  thereby  reducing  the 
need  to  implement  costly  monitoring  and  sanctioning 
systems. In certain organizational contexts where central-
ized  monitoring  of  team  performance  is  impossible, 
selecting  organizational  members  based  on  individual 
differences in trust may stabilize group norms of perfor-
mance and ultimately enhance productivity.

An  intriguing  implication  of  the  present  research  is 
that the success of large-scale institutions may be founded 
on  harnessing  the  stabilizing  effects  of  informal  social 
processes promoting cooperation (Cook, Hardin, & Levi, 
2005). Indeed, authorities and institutions may benefit by 
recognizing some degree of self-determination by local 
communities  (Ostrom,  1990).  So  in  many  ways,  it  may 
well be the local, informal enforcement of social norms 
of cooperation that maintains trust in others, which then 
provides  the  fertile  ground  for  broader  institutional 
mechanisms to further ensure the trustworthiness of oth-
ers  via  increased  monitoring  and  sanctioning  (Cook  
et  al.,  2005).  Thus,  cost-effective  institutional  solutions 
may take advantage of the knowledge and ability of indi-
viduals  to  solve  their  own  public  goods  and  commons 
dilemmas (Ostrom, 1990). It may simply be unnecessary 
for a strong and costly Leviathan to monitor and sanction 
societal members’ behavior in order to sustain coopera-
tion. It is all the more interesting that these local, inter-
personal  mechanisms  are  so  clearly  uncovered  in  the 
constraints of a laboratory where strangers are faced with 
the challenges of a public good dilemma.

Limitations and future directions
There  are  some  limitations  worth  noting  that  may  be 
addressed  in  future  research.  First,  the  measure  of  trust 
taken by the WVS is not without criticisms. Some defini-
tions of trust presume that people can be both trusting and 
suspicious of others (Yamagishi, 2011), and there may be 
systematic  differences  across  cultures  in  whom  people 
think  about  when  they  are  asked  to  think  about  “most 
people.” Although this question has limitations, responses 
to this question have been found to predict cross-societal 
differences  in  wealth  (e.g.,  Knack  &  Keefer,  1997)  and 
civic participation (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, & 
Vishny,  1997).  Nonetheless,  future  work  will  strengthen 
our conclusions by examining cultural differences in trust

by using different measures and relating this to the effect 
of punishment on cooperation in public goods.

Another limitation is that the sample of experimental 
studies  included  in  the  meta-analysis  were  conducted 
with  university  students.  Although  this  may  provide  a 
benefit by drawing relatively comparable samples across 
societies, university students in large-scale modern indus-
trialized societies tend not to capture the broad range of 
cultural  differences  observed  across  large-  and  small-
scale  societies  (Henrich,  Heine,  &  Norenzayan,  2010). 
Future  research  should  determine  whether  our  results 
generalize to the broader range of cultures present in the 
world.

Finally, although the experimental studies all involved 
a highly standardized experimental procedure, the exper-
iments were conducted by different experimenters in dif-
ferent  labs.  Certainly,  a  gold  standard  of  cross-cultural 
research  is  to  have  a  single  experimenter  develop  and 
apply the same procedure across societies, with a close 
look at language and for economic experiments such as 
these, the value of outcomes used in specific studies (see 
Herrmann et al., 2008). Nonetheless, despite these limita-
tions, a meta-analytic approach, with the ability to look 
across more studies in more countries than is often the 
case at the study level, remains a powerful tool to exam-
ine variation in studies across societies and test theory of 
potential cross-cultural differences.

Concluding Remarks
Free riding is one of the most serious threats to public 
goods and may therefore pose an important risk to the 
functioning  of  groups,  organizations,  and  societies. 
Although punishment has been identified as a powerful 
solution  to  the  free-rider  problem,  the  effectiveness  of 
punishment as a tool to promote cooperation varies con-
siderably across societies. The intriguing question now is 
what we have referred to as a puzzle of punishment: Is 
punishment more effective in low-trust societies or high-
trust societies?

The meta-analysis provides a clear answer: Punishment 
is more effective in promoting cooperation (and reducing 
free riding) in high-trust societies than in low-trust societ-
ies. We have suggested that punishment, as discussed in 
terms  of  norm  enforcement,  and  trust  might  reinforce 
each other in promoting cooperation—rather than exist-
ing in a simple unidirectional causal relation. Such rein-
forcement  of  trust  and  norm  enforcement—that  trust 
provides  a  supporting  environment  for  norm  enforce-
ment, and that effective informal norm enforcement pro-
motes trust—helps us understand why certain groups and 
collectives have higher and lower levels of cooperation.

The present findings underline the importance of trust, 
punishment,  and  cooperation  as  three  ingredients  that 

may help us understand why some societies are on their 
way to stability and growth, while other societies are not. 
We  found  evidence  of  the  positive  association  between 
societies’ levels of trust and the enforcement of coopera-
tive group norms in experimental social dilemmas, which 
are  often  conceptualized  as  two  components  of  social 
capital  that  relate  to  the  successful  workings  of  groups, 
organizations, and even nations. Furthermore, we found 
support  that  the  informal  punishment  of  cooperative 
group  norms  is  more  effective  in  societies  involving 
greater  participation  of  societal  members  in  politics,  a 
hallmark  of  a  healthy  democracy.  Thus,  an  intriguing 
implication  is  that  trust  and  cooperative  norm  enforce-
ment,  as  a  form  of  social  capital,  result  in  prosperous 
large-scale societies, and in many ways “make the world 
go round.”

Notes
1. Past research has examined two distinct forms of sanction-
ing systems, punishments administered by a centralized author-
ity (e.g., Baldassarri & Grossman, 2011; Mulder, van Dijk, De 
Cremer,  &  Wilke,  2006)  and  punishments  delivered  by  peers 
(Fehr  &  Gächter,  2002).  In  the  present  research,  we  focused 
on the (costly) peer punishment administered in the Fehr and 
Gächter  (2002)  research  protocol,  because  a  standardized 
experimental protocol has been developed and used in most 
studies on this topic. This standardized protocol has also been 
used  in  various  countries  over  the  past  decade,  thus  allow-
ing  for  a  relatively  straightforward  empirical  analysis  to  illu-
minate  this  puzzle  of  punishment.  Therefore,  when  we  refer 
to punishment throughout this article, we refer to this form of 
punishment.
2. When we used the WVS, we were able to code all countries 
included in the meta-analysis for religious participation, norms 
of  civic  cooperation,  and  trust,  except  Greece  and  Denmark. 
For these two countries, we used the EVS, which asks the same 
questions, to calculate and code these variables.
3. The dataset can be obtained from Daniel Balliet’s Web site at  
http://www.psy.vu.nl/nl/over-de-faculteit/medewerkers- 
alfabetisch/medewerkers-a-b/d-balliet/index.asp.
4. We examined the possibility that cross-societal variation in 
trust has a nonlinear relation with the effect of punishment on 
cooperation. We examined both the quadratic and logarithmic 
transformations of trust and their relations with the effect size 
and did not find any support for a nonlinear relation.
5. We also computed the interaction between trust and democ-
racy  and  added  the  interaction  term  to  the  model  predicting 
the effect size. The interaction was not a significant predictor 
of the effect size.
6.  Additional  research  has  found  that  religious  beliefs  relate 
to  higher  amounts  of  cooperation  and  wealth  across  societ-
ies  (Atkinson  &  Bourrat,  2011;  Barro  &  McCleary,  2003).  In

the supplementary material, we coded and analyzed whether 
cross-societal variation in religious beliefs predicted the effect 
of punishment on cooperation. Religious beliefs did not have a 
significant relation with the effect size.
